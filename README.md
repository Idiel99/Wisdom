Django Application.

This web app I completed when I was just getting started with Django and Python through Udemy. 

Its a simple application that lets you "adopt" pets 

You are able to see all the pets names and the vaccines that they have. Also there's a picture of the pets that you would like to see. 

Moreover, there's an admin page in which you can change add/delete pets with the Django admin view.
